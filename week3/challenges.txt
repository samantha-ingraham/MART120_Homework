I have overcome many challenges, most of which I am uncomfortable sharing with the general public. Those challenges shaped me in some ways, but mostly I shaped myself. I experienced them, came out the other side and decided I did not want to be a bitter, angry person anymore. It caused me to leave the army and pursue higher education. Again, i saw the field I was in was already making me feel more angry, and bitter about the world than it had before. So I changed majors, and am able to find a little joy in my learning experiences every day.
