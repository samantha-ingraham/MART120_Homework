Learning styles

	I completely agree with the article. Learning styles are not paramount to the amount of useable information you retain, though I do think they indicate how you would figure something out on your own. For example, in my biology classes listening to someone who is passionate about a subject helps me retain something. Writing short papers helps me retain information. Watching documentaries also works. Actually doing experiments, however, doesnâ€™t help at all. I do the experiment, and answer the questions, and then immediately forget what the point of it was. In contrast, during my time as a mechanic, taking a cursory glance at a manual before removing something and then just diving in was how I figured out how to take something apart. When building furniture, I tend to just try things until something works, same with coding and gardening and everything else that I have a genuine interest in. According to the test results however, experiments SHOULD help me more than anything else! So it is largely dependent on what kind of information a student is trying to learn, and how interested they are in that information personally. If a student is interested in it, they might be more likely to learn it in the same manner as their learning style indicates. If they are not, they might rely on other methods that force the information to stick long enough to get past the test.
