this is where we will write about gui and cli in about 200 words

so far as i can tell, GUI and CLI can accomplish the same things, but CLI has all the padding peeled off of it. GUI is user friendly, and self explanatory, where-as CLI is just box without visual reminders of what things are. While both have their uses, CLI can be more frustrating for someone unfamiliar to use for the first time. in the screenshots taken, you can see that my comouter defaults to using one drive, so all of my folders were in a different location in cli than initially expected. in gui, finding them is easy, i can just click around and look until i find where the folder is. in cli it is a bit more complicated, because it initially starts you off in c dive. I had to navigate back to home, and then follow the directory path down to one drive and from there on to where my mart120 folder was. I was able to create a test folder, but it didnt keep the name test folder, instead making two folders, one named test and the other folder. overall, cli seems most useful for getting at the guts of a program, while gui is better for every day use.
